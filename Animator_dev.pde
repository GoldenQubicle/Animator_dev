  probably need additional logic checks and/or hard reset, i.e. clear ani and rebuild
  


so current thinking on how to actually edit the segment value
add a scrollable list to track control which contains segments
select segment from it => it lights up and timeline jumps to proper place
then and only then is the anisegment value able to be editted
this supposes there's also a way to de-select, possible by an empty entry in scrollable list (or on collapse?!)

moreover this idea could be extended to trackcontrol themselves
say for instance there > 5 color wheels. Instead of having all 5 individually on screen
I could have 1 color wheel with 2 scrollable list next to it
first I select which variable I want (i.e. which track) and once selected tracks lights up, and second list fills
then from second list I select actual segment to edit

of course there're halve a dozen ways to go about 
however the (two tiered) concept of scrollable list(s) next to controls has potential
